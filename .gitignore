# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# root
# Ignore environment file
.ENV
.vscode/

# api
# Ignore bundler config.
api/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
api/log/*
api/tmp/*
!api/log/.keep
!api/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
api/tmp/pids/*
!api/tmp/pids/
!api/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
api/storage/*
!api/storage/.keep
api/tmp/storage/*
!api/tmp/storage/
!api/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
api/config/master.key
